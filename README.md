Python program where users can find the word definitions.
I have used pandas.Pandas is a fast, powerful, flexible and easy to use open source data analysis and manipulation tool, built on top of the Python programming language.
get_close_matches(inputWord, dataSet, n) is used to find the n best matches.
By default n=3.
To get the top best match, we can use get_close_matches(inputWord, dataSet, n)[0] since get_close_matches returns a list.
